        immense natural beauty. Embraced by the Arabian Sea in the west and a network of lakes, lagoons and freshwater
        rivers criss-crossing it, this backwater country is home toa vibrant animal and avian life. By virtue of its
        proximity to the sea, the town has always carved out an exclusive place for itself in the maritime history of
        Kerala.</p>
