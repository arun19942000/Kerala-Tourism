    <p>A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of pilgrim
        worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous terrains comprising natural divisions of the
        lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves,
        more than fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests.
