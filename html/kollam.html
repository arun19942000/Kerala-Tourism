    <p>One of the premier trade capitals of the Old World, Kollam is the centre of the countryâ€™s cashew trading and
        processing industry. Extolled by Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta in glowing terms, this was once a famous port of
        international spice trade. This historic town is home to the celebrated Ashtamudi Lake, making it a gateway to
        the breath-taking backwaters of Kerala. The eight-hour boat trip between Kollam and Alappuzha is the longest and
        most enchanting experience on the backwaters of Kerala. The momentous decision to introduce a new Malayalam era
        was convened at Kollam and hence the Malayalam calendar came to be known as kollavarsham.</p>
