        Malappuram district has a rich and vibrant history. The military headquarters of the Zamorins of Kozhikode since
        ancient times, this district was the site for many of the Mappila Revolts (uprising against the British East
        India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram literally means a land atop hills and the region is
        enriched by three great rivers flowing through it - the Chaliyar, Kadalundi and the Bharathapuzha.
