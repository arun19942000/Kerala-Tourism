    <p>Celebrated as the Granary of Kerala, Palakkad is a vast stretch of fertile plains interspersed with hills,
        rivers, mountain streams and forests. The gateway to Kerala from the north, a 40 kilometre break in the
        mountains known as the Palakkad Gap gives access to this land situated at the foot of the Western Ghats. The
        pass acts as a corridor between Kerala and the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and played a key role in the trade
        relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular India. Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala
        (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest), this place was once a stunning expanse of forest covered with the
        sweet-scented flowers of the Pala tree. A potpourri of Tamil and Kerala culture, some of the finest Carnatic
        musicians hail from this district which continues to be a principally agrarian society.
