    <p>The legendary seaport where Arab, Chinese and East African traders once converged, Kozhikode was previously the
        most crucial region of the Malabar Coast. Vasco da Gama landed on its shores in 1498, shooting the region to
        global fame. Once the capital of the influential Zamorins and a prominent trade and commerce centre, the winds
        of change have swept over this charming coastal land. The whiff of history continues to permeate the lanes,
        bazaars and business hubs of Kozhikode. Lush green countryside, serene beaches, historic sites, wildlife
        sanctuaries, rivers and hills make Kozhikode a popular destination.</p>
