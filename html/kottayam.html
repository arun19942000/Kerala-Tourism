    <p>Kottayam district is famous for its rich heritage and literary tradition. It is renowned for its spice and rubber
        trade. Cradled by the backwaters and the Western Ghats, it is epitomised by its stretches of vast greenery,
        paddy fields and huge rubber plantations. Over five of the State’s leading newspaper publications originate from
        Kottayam. About four-fifth of books published in the State come from here as well. From trekking hotbeds like
        Nadukani and Kottathavalam to the rare avian life on display at the Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, this district
        encompasses everything that God’s Own Country is famous for. Well connected to the entire State, it is full of
        interesting historical and cultural locations that tell the tale of how the district was forged into its current
        form..</p>
