    <p>Idukki is Kerala's second largest district and has been blessed with numerous natural wonders. The high valleys
        and hill ranges of this landlocked region are fed by three major rivers - Periyar, Thalayar and Thodupuzhayar
        and their tributaries. Its forest still hosts many tribes and over half of the terrain is still covered with
        forests. People love going to the gigantic arch dam for getting its mesmerising view. Blessed with a wide range
        of trekking trail, each of them offers a spectacular view of the valley below and ranges above of Idukki. The
        place is also renowned for its exotic flora and fauna and one can come across many rare species while visiting
        Idukki.</p>
